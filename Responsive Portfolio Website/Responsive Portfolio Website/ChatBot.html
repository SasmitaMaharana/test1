                    <p>It reads the sample data tokenized the text of the sample data into a list of sentences using tokenize function 
                        present in NLTK library.Then I tokenized the text again into another variable and lower cased alphabets and 
                        removed all of the stopwords present in the English language.Then I ranked all of the sentences according to their Q-phrases list which means every sentence having the the words present in Q-phrase will get higher rank. 
                        Then I calculated a final score of the sentences by virtue of all the other rankings done 
                        above. Hence, sentences have a score higher a average score are included in the final 
                        
                        The user is asked to input the question which is further tokenized. 
                        The words in question are lowered and is identified to be a “When”, “Where” or “Who” 
                        type question. 
                        Then, the tokenized words are lowered and the stopwords and punctuations are removed. 
                        Then I rank all the sentences of the summary according to the number of the words in 
                        each sentence matching with words present in question (containing only tokenized, 
                        lower-cased words of the question with no stopwords and punctuation). The word having 
                        higher number of words are ranked higher. 
                        The sentence having the higher rank is selected to be the answer sentence. 
                        If the question is of “When” type as identified from point 2 then we answer only the 
                        numeric data present in the answer sentence. 
                        Else if the question is of “Who” or “Where” type then, the answer only contains the proper 
                        nouns present in the answer sentence.</p>
